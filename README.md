#Bassiat

This website was one of my last projects. I was responsible for all the back-end part of the website and some adjustments in the front-end.

#### What did I use?
Developed with PHP, I used the framework [Codeigniter 3.0.1](https://github.com/bcit-ci/CodeIgniter) to do the whole site.

The database used is Mysql and here is the [dump file](/bassiat_site.sql)
